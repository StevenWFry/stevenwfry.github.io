    <h1 class="post-title">Pirate Copilot: Building a Website with AI Without Losing the Plot</h1>
    <p class="post-subtitle">A practical breakdown of what I built, what Copilot actually helped with, and what still needed real human judgment.</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-body">
    <h2 id="why">Why I Built Pirate Copilot</h2>
    <p>Pirate Copilot started as a simple experiment: could I ship a complete, fun microsite while using AI as a collaborator instead of a code vending machine?</p>
    <p>I wanted something visual, opinionated, and small enough to finish quickly. The pirate theme gave me enough creative direction to keep design and content decisions focused.</p>

    <h2 id="stack">Stack and Structure</h2>
    <p>The site lives in <code>/pirate-copilot</code> in this repo and uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No framework, no build pipeline, no dependencies.</p>
    <p>That constraint matters. It forced the project to stay understandable and easy to iterate on. AI suggestions were useful, but simple architecture made those suggestions safe to adopt.</p>

    <pre data-lang="text"><code>pirate-copilot/
  index.html
  css/styles.css
  js/scripts.js
  js/3d-model.js
  images/</code></pre>

    <h2 id="workflow">What Copilot Helped With</h2>
    <p>Copilot was strongest on speed tasks:</p>
    <p><strong>Boilerplate and repetitive markup.</strong> It filled out predictable sections quickly.</p>
    <p><strong>CSS scaffolding.</strong> Useful for rough layout structure before manual polish.</p>
    <p><strong>JavaScript stubs.</strong> Good at getting a first pass of interaction logic started.</p>

    <div class="callout tip">
      <div class="callout-label">$ rule that worked</div>
      <p>I treated Copilot output as a draft, never a final answer. Review first, keep second.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="limits">Where AI Was Not Enough</h2>
    <p>Three areas still depended on manual decisions:</p>
    <p><strong>Visual taste.</strong> Copilot can generate CSS, but it does not know your aesthetic bar.</p>
    <p><strong>Content voice.</strong> The tone needed to match the project personality, which required direct writing and editing.</p>
    <p><strong>Performance and cleanup.</strong> AI can over-generate classes and scripts. I trimmed dead code and simplified aggressively.</p>

    <h2 id="lessons">Lessons from the Project</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Start with constraints.</strong> Small scope beats ambitious scope.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Keep files readable.</strong> Clean structure makes AI assistance safer.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Use AI for momentum, not authority.</strong> You still own architecture, correctness, and final quality.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Ship, then refine.</strong> Getting to a live version quickly made improvements easier to prioritize.</p>

    <h2 id="whats-next">What I Would Add Next</h2>
    <p>If I continue Pirate Copilot, I would add:</p>
    <p><strong>Accessibility pass.</strong> Stronger keyboard navigation and contrast checks.</p>
    <p><strong>Asset optimization.</strong> Compress images and tighten delivery for faster load times.</p>
    <p><strong>Content expansion.</strong> A short behind-the-scenes section for design and implementation notes.</p>

    <h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
    <p>Pirate Copilot proved that AI can speed up a web project, but only when the human running it has clear constraints and editorial control.</p>
    <p>The biggest win was not generated code. It was reduced friction between idea and a working first version.</p>
